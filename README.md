# Algorithms for machine learning 

![PYTHON](https://github.com/dame-cell/100daysofml/assets/122996026/295df7c7-387e-4d0a-8d09-d383ebda0323)

## Description 

This repository is aimed at beginners who are starting their journey in machine learning. It provides code implementations from scratch for various machine-learning algorithms. The focus is not only on understanding the underlying mathematics but also on coding the algorithms to gain a deeper understanding.

Please note that while I have made an effort to ensure accuracy, there may be some mistakes in the code. I welcome feedback and constructive criticism as I continue to learn and improve. also i did not add linear regression

### This repository contains code from scratch  for algorithms such as   :

* [Logistic Regression](https://100daysofml/Logisticregression.ipynb)
* [Ridge Regression or l2 or regularization](https://100daysofml/ridgeregression.ipynb)
* [Ridge Gradient Regression](https://100daysofml/ridgegradientregression.ipynb)
* [lasso Regression or l1 or regularization ](https://100daysofml/Lassoregression.ipynb)
* [elastic Regression or regularization ](https://100daysofml/Elasticnet.ipynb)
* [polynomial Regression](https://100daysofml/polynomialregression.ipynb)
* [batch Gradient Descent](https://100daysofml/batchgradientdescent.ipynb)
* [Stochastic Regression](https://100daysofml/stocasticregression.ipynb)
* [MINI-Batch](https://100daysofml/minibatch.ipynb)

* ## will be adding more.....


## Usage

Each algorithm is organized into separate files or directories. To use an algorithm, follow the instructions provided in the corresponding code file. You may need to install certain dependencies or libraries, so please refer to the instructions and ensure you have the required environment set up.
