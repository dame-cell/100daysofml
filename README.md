# Algorithms for machine learning 

![PYTHON](https://github.com/dame-cell/100daysofml/assets/122996026/295df7c7-387e-4d0a-8d09-d383ebda0323)

## Description 
this is a repository for people who are starting  their journey in machine learning 

## One thing   I believe is that in order to fully understand the different algorithms we need to understand not only the maths behind it but also code the algo from scratch  

### p.s -  I did most of the coding myself so there may be some mistakes here and there but I am open to criticism  and to keep on learning 

### This repository contains code from scratch
